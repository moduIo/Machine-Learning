HW1 is mathematical review (linear algebra, probability, statistics, calculus proofs) and learning theory along with an implementation of Ordinary Least Squares regression, an incremental formulation of Least Squares, and Polynomial Least Squares regression.

HW2 includes implementations of Perceptron Learning Algorithm, Support Vector Machines, Ridge Regression and various derivations.

HW3 includes implementations of (Gaussian) Kernel SVM, (Gaussian) Kernel Ridge Regression, and Linear SVM using Subgradient Descent along with various proofs and derivations.
