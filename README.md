CSE 512 Machine Learning - Spring 2017 - Stony Brook University

## HW1
Mathematical review (linear algebra, probability, statistics, calculus proofs) and learning theory along with an implementation of Ordinary Least Squares regression, an incremental formulation of Least Squares, and Polynomial Least Squares regression.

## HW2
Includes implementations of Perceptron Learning Algorithm, Support Vector Machines, Ridge Regression and various derivations.

## HW3 
Includes implementations of (Gaussian) Kernel SVM, (Gaussian) Kernel Ridge Regression, and Linear SVM using Subgradient Descent along with various proofs and derivations.

## HW4 
Includes implementations Kernel SGD and k-means Clustering over the classic MNIST dataset.  Also included are a variety of derivations and proofs on topics including PCA, boosting, and the EM algorithm.

## HW5 
This was the class Kaggle competition (detailed here https://inclass.kaggle.com/c/cse512).  

Working with a real world dataset of half a million samples, our goal was to determine if two individuals using the eHarmony dating platform would be compatible or not.  My attempt used polynomial feature mappings with regularized least squares regression along with implementations for SGD and logistic regression with mini-batches and over/under-sampling.
